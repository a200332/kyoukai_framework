  <strong>The Boundary, A Simple Framework for A Small Server Application</strong>
</div>
<br/>

The Kyoukai (境界), A Simplified Pascal Web Framework.

In japanese, kyoukai means boundary, because it's bounds me as my favourite programming language. The concept is, Kyoukai can be embedded into you desktop application or just leave it as and separated single program, so you can decided which is better, bound it into your existing application or not.

I make Pascal because I can not find any Pascal web-framework which I really comfort with. Some are too complicated, while some others have too many dependencies. Basically I expect an easy-to-use framework like CodeIgniter in Pascal, even more simpler than CodeIgniter.

This project is too far from a complete framework, it still in the experimental stage, please help me if you have any idea, code, and feature request. And, Don't too silly to open any issue.

Requirement
---
* fpc / free pascal compiler, version 3.0.4
